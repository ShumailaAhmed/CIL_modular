Here are the scripts for data collection and evaluation. 

So the process is to run the collect data script. Then clean the data manually and run the convertwp script. 
Then train a model with corresponding config file, e.g.
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES='0' python chauffeur.py train -e mm408_rc28_wpz_M_mm45_dr -pt /home/muellem/Downloads/Desktop/
Then evaluate model (see batch files for examples).
